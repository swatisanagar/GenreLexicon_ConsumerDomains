<h1>Genre Sentiemnt Lexicon Resources</h1>

This sentiment lexicon to be used for sentiment analysis in English for Consumer review domains.
The set of sentiment lexicons are created as a part of research work by Swati Sanagar and her thesis advisor Dr.Deepa Gupta using Genre-based approach.
<h1>What's the Genre-based Sentiemnt Lexicon Learning</h1>
<h3>A brief explaination about the Genre-based snetiment lexicon is given below.</h3>
  *Sentiment lexicon the ready-to use resource. The general purpose sentiment lexicons are observed inefficeint in domain-based work whereas domain-based efficient sentiment lexison learning demands labeled data for every new domain. We present a genre-based approach to learn sentiment lexicon at genre-level. The genre-based process learns meta knowlege from preselected source domains. The meta-knowledge is used for learning multiple sentiment lexicon under the genre.

<h1>The Contributions</h1>
The contribution includes research work conducted and presented across different publications. 

    \*The Multidomain Sentiment Lexicon includes ready to use consumer review domain lexicons.
    \*The Genre-based Combined Sentiment Lexicon contain meta-genre-based lexicon, a seed sentiment lexicon.
    \*The genre-seed word, a polarity seed-set


<h2>The Multidomains Sentiment Lexicons</h2>
The folder "ConsumerGenre_Lexicon" contains consumer review domains sentiment lexicon for 18 domains.
For more details refer [the following research paper.]()

<h2>The Genre-based Combined Sentiment Lexicon</h2>
This lexicon contain Genre_based_Lexicon applicable to any domain from consumer review genre. It contains positive and negative lexicon. This can be used as seed lexicon in sentiment analysis work under consumer review domains. This is available in folder 'Genre_based_Lexicon'. To know more about how this sentiment lexicon learned check [here]()

<h2>The Genre-based Polarity Seed Words Set</h2>
The polarity seed words is set of 35 positive and 35 negative seed words. These are applicable to consumer review domains. The application of seed words in unsupervised setup is explained in the paper [here]<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9126775>

<h1>How to use</h1>
The Sentiment lexicons can be downlaoded and used directly. It is learned using consumer review domains. The sentiment words are in lemmatized form.
